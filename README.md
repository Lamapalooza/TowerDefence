# TowerDefence
I present to your attention a game in the style of tower defense. Prevent enemies from reaching the city wall by placing towers with various types of weapons on the field. Ground enemies will change their route, avoiding obstacles, and those that can fly will test the effectiveness of your defense for strength.

To start the game, open the project in the Unity editor version 2022.1.0b16 or later, select the start scene and press the play button in the editor. After pressing the spacebar on the starting scene, the game will start. You can go to the turret shop, choose the one you like and put it anywhere on the map (Just remember to check if you have enough money for it!). Enjoy the game!
